Data can be found on the storage at 
`/cfs/share/data/RTM/Lautern`

Brainstorming on what to store in the .h5 data file:
* Did the sim run through?
* Perc of how much it ran through
* Type of output frequency: step/time/perc
* Time it took
* ...
* 

Some can be derived from the data, but some info my need to be added as well.
