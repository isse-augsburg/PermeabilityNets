Data can be found on the storage at 
`/cfs/share/data/RTM/Lautern/[output, simulation_files]`

Brainstorming on what to store in the .h5 data file:
* [x]  Sigmas etc. 
* [x]  Used shapes, their size, placement and FVC
* [x]  Type of output frequency: step/time/perc
* [ ]  Did the sim run through?
* [ ]  Perc of how much it ran through
* [ ]  Time it took

* ...

Some can be derived from the data, but some info my need to be added as well.
